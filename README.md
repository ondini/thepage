# thepage.

**thepage.** is a landing page I use as a redirection from time wasting websites, such as social networks.
I use it in combination with firefox extensions ([LeechBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) on phone and [Block Site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/block-website/) on laptop ), where I set which websites to redirect from.

**thepage.** contains suggestions on activities which may be way more useful and some motivation quotes of course! And also a flying jackdaw. :open_mouth:
